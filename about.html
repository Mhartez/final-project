        <h1>Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II (The Bite Fight)</h1>
    
        <p>On June 28, 1997, one of the more bizarre moments in boxing history took place when Mike Tyson bit off a portion of Evander Holyfield's ear in the third round of their much-anticipated rematch. Tyson was disqualified from the bout and lost his boxing license. He was later reinstated.</p>

            <p>Tyson had started his career with a bang, breaking Rocky Marciano's record of most consecutive wins by KO/TKO to start a career with 19, a record that has since been broken by a few other fighters.</p>
            
            
            <p>the tutelage of trainer Cus D'Amato, Tyson turned pro at the age of 18 and would go on to win his first world title in his 28th pro fight at age 20 (a second-round TKO over Trevor Berbick), making him the youngest heavyweight champion in history.</p>
            
            <p> star power that "Iron" Mike brought to the sport of boxing has rarely been seen since. Among heavyweights, he has been a part of some of the biggest money-making fights in history. Tyson has been a part of four of the six largest gates in Nevada heavyweight boxing history.</p>
            
            <p>the time, Holyfield-Tyson II was the highest-grossing PPV (1.99 million buys) and the first to break $100 million in revenues. Holyfield was one of three fighters Tyson would face on multiple occasions -- Donovan Ruddock and Frank Bruno were the others. Tyson went 2-0 vs. both Bruno and Ruddock but 0-2 against Holyfield.</p>
